# HOW TO C??? (I don’t know what I’m doing)

---

NOTE: THE EXE(s) WILL BE FLAGGED BY WINDOWS  
Just hit **MORE INFO** then **RUN ANYWAY** if you wanna run them. No promises tho.
Oh, and some exe's will close automatically after the program runs because I forgot to add **one**l line of code...Too bad, compile it yourself.
